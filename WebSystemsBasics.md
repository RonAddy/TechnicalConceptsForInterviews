# Web Systems Basics

### HTTP vs. HTTPS
- HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to.
- S stands for 'Secure' and typically use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encyrpt all communications between your browser and the website encrypted.
- TLS and SSL both use 'asymmetric' Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, which uses a public key and a private key to encrypt communications. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and vice-versa.
- HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
